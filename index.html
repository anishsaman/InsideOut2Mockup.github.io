        <p id="P2"> Popularity! Cool Hair! The cute boy in math class! Envy wants it all--- even if what she so desperately desires may not 
            be her's. She wants Riley to have the very best 
            of absolutely everything, and knows she can. If other people can have what they want, why wouldn't Riley deserve the same, if not, better!? 
            While admirable, will such desire turn into greed and jealousy? </p>

                class="image">

        <p id="P3"> Meh. That's all she's got. Ennui is bored. So very bored. Nothing excites her and she've even more unimpressed by the shenagians of 
            the other emotions. She endlessly scrolls on her 
            phone, and no avail, finds nothing interesting. You can find her in a doctor's waiting room, a math lesson in class, or when Dad starts to blab about work. 
            Good luck trying to crack anything out of her.
